Detailed Report on PropEase Project Issues
Project Structure Overview

Frontend: Located in frontend/, uses React, TypeScript, Vite, and multiple UI libraries (Chakra UI, MUI, Radix UI). Key directories include src/assets/, src/components/, src/pages/, and src/services/.
Backend: Located in backend/, uses Node.js, Express, and Supabase. Key directories include src/controllers/, src/routes/, and src/services/.
Database: Located in database/, uses Supabase with a schema defined in schema.sql, including tables like activity_logs, announcements, and properties.
Deployment: Frontend deployed via AWS Amplify, backend via AWS Elastic Beanstalk, with CI/CD pipelines defined in .github/workflows/.

Identified Issues and Resolutions
Issue 1: AWS Amplify Build Spec Syntax Error
Description: The new amplify.yml script fails with the error "Invalid build spec format: Please provide valid YML syntax," preventing successful builds in AWS Amplify. The old script works because it uses a heredoc (<< 'EOF') to encapsulate multi-line commands, avoiding YAML parsing issues.
Implications: This prevents deployment of the frontend, stalling updates and potentially affecting user access to new features or fixes.
Steps to Address:

Use Heredoc for Multi-line Commands: Replace multiple echo commands for creating vite.config.js with a single heredoc block to ensure YAML parser compatibility.
Ensure Consistent Indentation: Use exactly two spaces for indentation, avoiding tabs or inconsistent spacing.
Remove Non-ASCII Characters: Replace emojis (e.g., 👉, 🧪) with plain text to prevent parser issues.
Validate YAML Syntax: Use a YAML linter like yamllint to verify the script before uploading.
Save in UTF-8 with LF Line Endings: Ensure the file is saved in UTF-8 encoding with Unix-style (LF) line endings to avoid platform-specific issues.

Example:
- |
  cat > vite.config.js << 'EOF'
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
  import path from 'path';
  import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

  const __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
      },
    },
    build: {
      outDir: 'build',
    },
  });
  EOF

Issue 2: Vite Package Not Found
Description: Build logs indicate that Vite fails with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND because the vite package is not found locally in the frontend directory’s node_modules. The npx vite build command attempts to install Vite on-the-fly, which is unreliable.
Implications: This causes build failures, preventing the frontend from being deployed, and may lead to inconsistent build results due to version mismatches.
Steps to Address:

Install Vite Locally: Add a command in the preBuild phase to install Vite and its React plugin as dev dependencies.
Use Local Vite Binary: In the build phase, use the local Vite binary (./node_modules/.bin/vite) to ensure consistent execution.
Specify Version: Use a specific version (e.g., 5.4.18) to match the project’s requirements and avoid automatic upgrades.
Verify Installation: Add a check to confirm Vite is installed before building.

Example: In preBuild commands:
- cd frontend
- npm install --save-dev vite@5.4.18 @vitejs/plugin-react@4.3.4
- if ./node_modules/.bin/vite --version >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "Vite installed"; else echo "Vite installation failed"; exit 1; fi

In build commands:
- cd frontend
- ./node_modules/.bin/vite build --mode production

Issue 3: SSM Secrets Configuration Warning
Description: Build logs show a warning: !Failed to set up process.env.secrets, indicating that Amplify cannot retrieve secrets from AWS SSM Parameter Store at /amplify/d3fa4pbfi6dm3q/main/. This suggests a misconfiguration or missing permissions.
Implications: While this doesn’t cause build failures, it may prevent the application from accessing necessary secrets (e.g., API keys), affecting runtime functionality.
Steps to Address:

Verify SSM Parameters: Check if parameters exist at the specified path using the AWS CLI or Console.
Grant Permissions: Ensure the Amplify role has permissions to access SSM parameters.
Configure Backend: If secrets are needed, initialize the Amplify backend with amplify init and amplify push.
Remove Reference if Unneeded: If secrets are not required, remove the SSM reference in Amplify’s configuration.
Test Access: Verify that the application can access secrets during runtime.

Example: Check parameters:
aws ssm get-parameters-by-path --path "/amplify/d3fa4pbfi6dm3q/main/" --recursive

Add permissions to the Amplify role:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ssm:GetParameter", "ssm:GetParametersByPath"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:account-id:parameter/amplify/d3fa4pbfi6dm3q/main/*"
    }
  ]
}

Issue 4: Manual Frontend Deployment
Description: The GitHub Actions workflow for the frontend (production.yml) builds the application but requires manual deployment from the Amplify Console, as indicated by the “Inform User About Deployment” step.
Implications: Manual deployment slows down the release process and increases the risk of human error, undermining the benefits of CI/CD automation.
Steps to Address:

Connect Repository: In the Amplify Console, connect the GitHub repository and select the main branch for automatic builds.
Configure Build Settings: Specify the amplify.yml script as the build configuration.
Enable Auto-Deploy: Enable automatic deployment on push to the main branch.
Update Workflow: Remove the manual deployment step from the workflow and rely on Amplify’s automation.
Test Deployment: Push a commit to verify that Amplify builds and deploys automatically.

Example: In Amplify Console:

Navigate to “App settings” > “General”.
Click “Connect branch” under “Repository”.
Select the PropEase repository and main branch.
Configure the build to use amplify.yml.

Issue 5: Lack of Automated Testing
Description: Neither the frontend nor backend package.json files include test scripts, indicating a lack of automated unit or integration tests. This increases the risk of bugs and regressions.
Implications: Without tests, code changes may introduce undetected errors, making maintenance and scaling difficult, especially for a complex application like PropEase.
Steps to Address:

Install Testing Frameworks: Use Jest for both frontend and backend, with additional libraries like React Testing Library for the frontend and Supertest for the backend.
Write Tests: Create unit tests for critical components (e.g., authentication, property management) and integration tests for API endpoints.
Add Test Scripts: Update package.json with test scripts.
Integrate with CI/CD: Run tests in the GitHub Actions workflow to catch issues before deployment.
Establish Test Coverage: Aim for at least 80% coverage for critical paths.

Example: For the backend, install Jest:
npm install --save-dev jest supertest

Add to backend/package.json:
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}

Create a test file in backend/__tests__/auth.test.js:
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../src/index');

describe('Auth API', () => {
  it('should register a new user', async () => {
    const res = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/signup')
      .send({
        email: 'test@example.com',
        password: 'password123',
        first_name: 'Test',
        last_name: 'User'
      });
    expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(201);
    expect(res.body).toHaveProperty('message', 'User created successfully');
  });
});

Issue 6: Lack of Linter for Backend
Description: The backend lacks a linter, as no ESLint or similar devDependencies are listed in backend/package.json, unlike the frontend, which uses ESLint.
Implications: Without a linter, code quality may suffer, leading to inconsistent styles, potential errors, and harder maintenance.
Steps to Address:

Install ESLint: Add ESLint and Node.js-specific plugins to the backend.
Configure ESLint: Create an .eslintrc.json file with rules tailored for Node.js and Express.
Add Lint Script: Include a lint script in backend/package.json.
Run in CI/CD: Add a lint step to the GitHub Actions workflow to enforce code quality.
Fix Existing Issues: Run ESLint and address reported issues.

Example: Install ESLint:
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-node

Create backend/.eslintrc.json:
{
  "env": {
    "node": true,
    "es2021": true
  },
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:node/recommended"
  ],
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 12
  },
  "rules": {
    "no-console": "warn"
  }
}

Add to backend/package.json:
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint ."
}

Issue 7: Outdated Dependencies
Description: Build logs show warnings about deprecated packages (e.g., inflight, rimraf, uuid), indicating outdated dependencies that may have security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues.
Implications: Deprecated or vulnerable dependencies can compromise security, cause runtime errors, or hinder compatibility with modern tools.
Steps to Address:

Check Outdated Dependencies: Run npm outdated to identify outdated packages in both frontend and backend.
Update Dependencies: Use npm update or manually update package.json with newer versions.
Audit for Vulnerabilities: Run npm audit and apply fixes with npm audit fix.
Automate Updates: Enable Dependabot in the GitHub repository to receive pull requests for dependency updates.
Test After Updates: Verify application functionality after updating dependencies to catch breaking changes.

Example: Run in both frontend/ and backend/ directories:
npm outdated
npm update
npm audit fix

Enable Dependabot by creating .github/dependabot.yml:
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/frontend"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/backend"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

Additional Observations

Multiple UI Libraries: The frontend uses Chakra UI, MUI, and Radix UI, which may increase bundle size and lead to inconsistent UI. Consider standardizing on one library unless specific features justify the mix.
Supabase Fallbacks: The backend’s createProperty controller uses fallbacks (RPC, direct insert, REST API), which may indicate database setup inconsistencies. Verify that Supabase RPC functions are consistently available.
Node.js Version in Elastic Beanstalk: The backend specifies Node.js 20 in package.json ("engines": ">=20.0.0"). Ensure the Elastic Beanstalk environment uses a compatible platform version, as older versions may not support Node.js 20.

Recommendations for Future Maintenance

Regular Code Reviews: Conduct periodic code reviews to catch issues early, focusing on security, performance, and maintainability.
Security Audits: Perform regular security audits, especially for authentication and database access, using tools like Snyk or OWASP ZAP.
Performance Monitoring: Use tools like New Relic or AWS CloudWatch to monitor application performance and identify bottlenecks.
Documentation: Maintain up-to-date documentation for setup, deployment, and API usage, leveraging the existing Swagger setup.
Backup Working Configurations: Keep versioned backups of working configuration files (e.g., amplify.yml) to revert if new changes fail.
