read my project files and help me in implementing the feature of adding tenants, owner, and vendors to the database and seeing a listing of them.

there is a people page with multiple tabs, each tab has a view of specific group of people the first tab is for all people, second for team members, thrid for owners, fourth tab for tenants, and fifth tab is for vendors.

each tab has an add button that shows a dialog to add each type of people, in the all people tab there is universal button that adds shows a menue to choose the type of person you want to add and then add shows a dialog to add each type.

in the team tab there is add team member to add team members, in the owner, tenant, and vendor tab each have a button to add each type.

now the current state of the peoples page is that i have completed the add team member flow, i am now working on the add vendor, owner, and tenant flows.

there is a difference between the team member and the other types addition is that for team members i need to authenticated the added user, and invite them to use complete their profile.

for the other types i don't need to do that i only need to add new records for each type of user in the database.

in the database in the schema.sql file you can see the structure of each of the tables i mentioned
team_members, vendors, tenants, and owners.

now given the information you have help me to plan to complete the people page, i need to work on the add vendors, tenants, and owners, buttons and dialog, list the peoples in the all peoples tab, the team members in team tab, owners, vendors, and tenants in each of their tab. 

Help me to refine or create the essential api's, edit the frontend and link it to the backend.

give me a plan to do so, along with a list of all related files that need to be changed.
